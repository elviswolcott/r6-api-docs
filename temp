Her interest in martial arts led her to enlist, but she quickly discovered that women weren’t allowed to serve in combat units. Despite all of her money and all of her social influence, she had found an obstacle between her and something she wanted, and it would not budge. Leaving the military, she created her own Private Security Company to operate within India’s borders, then a Private Military Company, NIGHTHAVEN, to operate overseas. She routinely negotiates multi-million-dollar contracts with incredibly favorable terms. Her ruthlessness is legendary, but by becoming a resource the Indian government desperately needs she has circumvented the laws that kept her from her goal and revalidated her self-perception as an unstoppable force in a largely static world.","PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT":"-- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}},"amaru":{"roles":["Flank","Font Line"],"armor":2,"speed":2,"ability":{"name":"GARRA HOOK","image":"https://static2.cdn.ubi.com/gamesites/rainbow6/operators/loadout/r6-operator-gadget-amaru.png"},"brief":"With the Garra Hook, Amaru can grapple onto ledges and windows and hoist herself up in record times.
